# BitstampPHP

**A PHP API wrapper class and a CLI** for the [Bitstamp REST API v2](https://www.bitstamp.net/api/). Please refer to [their documentation](https://www.bitstamp.net/api/) for calls descriptions.

Basically you can get Bitstamp's current exchange rates, place orders to trade Bitcoins for Euros or United States Dollars, check your open orders, see previous user transactions etc.

## Disclaimer

No guarantee or warranty implied. Use at your own risk. Be careful to set the right parameters expecially when placing orders. Please remember that I will take no responsibility for the integrity or reliability of this library and will not be responsible for any damage or loss of earnings caused by the use of this library.

### BitstampPHP PHP class usage

Example of usage

```php
$bitstamp = new Mx17\BitstampPHP\BitstampNet($localConfig);

$data = $bitstamp->ticker();
echo print_r($data, 1)."\n";
```

## Install

You need a working PHP environment (with `mbstring`) and [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

    sudo apt install php-mbstring composer
    git clone https://github.com/MaxChinni/BitstampPHP.git
    cd BitstampPHP/
    composer update

## Configure

Create a `config-local.php` with your data; that's for private API calls (which require authentication).

```bash
<?php
$localConfig = array(
    'bitstamp' => array(
        'customerId' => '000000',
        'apiKey' => 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
        'secret' => 'yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy',
        'currency' => 'btceur',
        'fiat' => 'eur'),
    'proxy' => array(
        'host' => '192.168.0.200',
        'port' => 8080,
        'username' => 'myUsername',
        'password' => 'mySecretPassword')
);
```
